                    Synergy is a website and mobile app designed to help users assess and offer feedback on wind turbine developments that will impact their community. The platform also serves as an educational resource for topics such as renewable energy, climate change, and wind energy legislation, and as a communication tool between community members and turbine developers.

                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>At times, local governments or regulatory bodies that plan and build wind turbines face backlash from their local community. This is often due to a lack of education around wind turbines, little community input on the development location, or a dislike of having to frequently see wind turbines.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How can we foster communication and discussion between communities and local regulatory bodies regarding wind turbine developments?</b>

                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p>Synergy aims to tackle this problem by incorporating two primary features:</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Providing a channel for community feedback on current wind turbine proposals.</li>
                    <li>Offering a centralized location for educational resources on wind turbines, renewable energy, local turbine legislation, and more.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>
                    By offering community members a way to establish a dialogue with planning bodies, Synergy hopes to aid these communities in collectively selecting ideal locations for wind turbines.

                <h1>Mobile App Design</h1>
                <p>
                    The mobile app design focuses on providing the user with up-to-date and relevant information right on the home page, from most recently updated proposals, to community highlights, to renewable energy news.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Proposal information includes space for in-depth explanations of turbine developments and even a way to view the location on a map. The library and community pages offer ways to access information and discussions quickly and easily.

                <p>
                    Desktop designs aimed to provide users with, at minimum, the same level of information as in the mobile app. Additionally, pages like the Proposals section were expanded to show even more relevant information and data.

                <h1>User</h1>
                <p>
                    With the primary design problem in mind, I started this design exercise by conducting research and creating user personas. I focused on a primary user persona, Paula, who is a homeowner, parent, and community member in an area that is actively undergoing a shift to wind energy.
                </p>
                <p><b>
                    “Paula loves the idea of renewable energy, but isn't so sure of wind turbines. She wants to understand where her local government is planning to build them and why, and how they may affect her, her home, and her family. As a community member who will be affected by these developements, she also wants to voice her opinion on the locations that have been chosen.”
                </b></p>

                <h1>Audit</h1>
                <p>
                    A competitive audit revealed that there were few, if any, direct competitors to Synergy. The study did highlight many established government or organization sites dedicated to providing generic educational content on renewable energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One site that came close to being a direct competitor was for an organization dedicated to providing information and activism on behalf of communities concerning wind energy and renewable energy projects. It was clear that Synergy could fill the gap between regulatory and community bodies.

                <p>
                    Following several ideation exercises, I landed on a design for the mobile app and created a low-fidelity prototype for user testing. The first design featured a news section on the home page. After user testing, I learned that including more locally relevant information on the home page would be beneficial.

                <p>
                    This project was a fantastic learning experience for both mobile app design and responsive website design. I was able to further develop my design process, practice my Figma design and prototyping skills, and work through a design with a higher degree of complexity than my last UX design exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed applying some of the design skills I learned in architecture, and even the skills and knowledge I’ve gained from creating this portfolio website. If I was to continue iterating on this project, the next piece I would tackle is the “Community” page, and the interactivity between users on discussion posts. Another area of development could be the representative side of the platform: for instance, designing for an elected official in charge of turbine developments, and how they might interact with and make use of the community feedback they receive through Synergy.
