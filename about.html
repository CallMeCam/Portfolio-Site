            <p>
                I consider myself a design generalist with interests spanning most facets of design, from architecture to content creation. I have strong interests in designing experiences and tools. My work has been described as atypical, and that’s exactly what I try to achieve. By recognizing ‘initial solutions’, we can work beyond them to arrive at something unique, and ideally, greater.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I enjoy most is ideating, innovating, and making discoveries throughout the design process.
